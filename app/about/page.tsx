                I don't just write code—I architect companies. My journey sits at the intersection of
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#6b4a49] dark:text-[#d4a574]"> technical depth</span> and
                <span className="font-semibold text-[#6b4a49] dark:text-[#d4a574]"> entrepreneurial execution</span>.
                I've launched multiple ventures from fun projects to revenue-generating platforms,
                navigating the full stack of startup challenges: product-market fit, team building,
                technical scalability, and user acquisition.

                What distinguishes my approach? <span className="font-semibold">Architectural foresight</span>.
                I build systems that anticipate scale from day one while remaining agile enough to pivot.
                Whether it's designing a secure P2P social marketplace or architecting a B2B SaaS
                platform, I focus on creating <span className="italic">foundational infrastructure</span>

                for maintainability and trust.
