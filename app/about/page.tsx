                Reliability is not an accident—it is an architecture. In an industry often obsessed with &quot;moving fast and breaking things,&quot;
                I take a different approach: <span className="font-semibold text-[#6b4a49] dark:text-[#d4a574]">move fast by building things that don&apos;t break</span>.
                I engineer systems that treat failure not as an anomaly to be feared, but as a constraint to be managed.

                My role extends beyond writing code; I build the digital bedrock that businesses stand on.
                Whether it&apos;s a high-frequency trading bot or a multi-tenant healthcare platform, the goal is always
                <span className="italic"> boring software</span>. Software that is boring because it works, predictable because it is strongly typed,
                and secure because it is designed that way from the first line of code.

                  &quot;True seniority is knowing what not to build. I focus on removing complexity, not adding it.
