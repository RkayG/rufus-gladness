      "Tenet is designed to solve the common challenges of building secure, compliant, and scalable SaaS applications without reinventing the wheel. Unlike most frameworks that require you to 'opt-in' to security checks, Tenet is **Security by Default**—meaning every handler automatically enforces strict input sanitization, authentication, and rate limiting unless explicitly exempted. By leveraging a declarative configuration object (`HandlerConfig`) and first-class TypeScript support, Tenet eliminates boilerplate and guarantees that inputs and database contexts are strictly typed and safe before your business logic ever runs.",
