    overview:
      "I designed and built a comprehensive API framework that transforms how teams build secure backend systems. Instead of writing hundreds of lines of boilerplate for authentication, validation, error handling, and authorization in every endpoint, developers write pure business logic in a declarative configuration. The framework handles everything else through advanced TypeScript generics that guarantee type safety from HTTP request → database → response. What makes it special? The ownership verification system that makes authorization bugs architecturally impossible—you can't forget to check if a user owns a resource because the framework does it automatically based on your configuration.",
